## Hi there 👋

### Who am I ? 📚
  - I'm a sophomore at Georgia Tech, College of Computing. I am working towards my B.S. Computer Science.
  - My threads are the Intelligence and Information Internetworks. I'm a full stack web developer, who mostly uses the MERN stack.

### Who am I really? 🔍❓
  - I love to code, because of the things we can create with it. 
  - Along with this I love to learn things I find challenging, like probability! 
  - Ocassionally I also make games in UE4 for fun. I also help [INFIMA Games](https://twitter.com/InfimaGames) with some features such as  in their Low Poly Shooter Pack for UE4.
