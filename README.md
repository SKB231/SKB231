## Hi there 👋

### Who am I ? 📚
  I'm a sophomore at Georgia Tech, College of Computing. I am working towards my B.S. Computer Science.
My threads are the Intelligence and Information Internetworks. 

### Who am I really? 🔍❓
  I'm someone who wants to understand the things we use everyday and make my own version of it. Along with this I love to code, because of the things we can create with it. I felt web development, both Frontend and Backend satisfy this. Along with this I love to learn things I find challenging, like probability! Ocassionally I also make games in UE4 for fun.
